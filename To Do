TO DO:
- metronome ( horitzontal line )
- rhythm enterer 
{
  * a table of checkboxes which export to an XML.
  * First row should be reserved for the "strong beat" to determine time signatures
  * Each following row is a different track
  * Need to support for different time signatures ie how many beats in the
  rhythm is variable (when mixing rhythms in the game need to ensure that time signatures match).
  * (Advanced) make the columns expandable and collapsable to allow for demi/semi quaver notes.
}
- playback
- "graphy.png" aligned with time_position
- nav pane CSS treeview
- welcome/about page

DONE:
