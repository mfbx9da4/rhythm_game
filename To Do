TO DO:
- metronome ( horitzontal line from top to bottom of canvas )
- rhythm enterer 
{
  * a table of checkboxes which export to an XML.
  * First row should be reserved for the "strong beat" to determine time signatures
  * Each following row is a different track
  * Need to support for different time signatures ie how many beats in the
  rhythm is variable (when mixing rhythms in the game need to ensure that time signatures match).
  * (Advanced) make the columns expandable and collapsable to allow for demi/semi quaver notes.
}
- playback (playback XML)
- "graphy.png" aligned with time_position
- welcome/about page
- Header image {
 * located above game, with word rhythmludus written and below it an interactive globe. 
 * Hovering over continents activates colour/shade changing. 
 * Clicking continents navigates to games with rhythms from that continent.
 * Active continent is coloured/shaded accordingly
 * Like http://simplemaps.com/world
}
- make nicer circles (gradient and border)
- size of canvas
- adjust radius of circles dynamically with n tracks
- silent track for metronome
- link the view pane with the game
- use a DB to store the song + usefull properties
- create user account
- ranking of players
- multiplayer mode
- rhythmTrainer.play() bug 

DONE:
- tree view nav pane (although need to do icons e.g http://www.webappers.com/category/design/icons/page/2/ and CSS is messy!)
